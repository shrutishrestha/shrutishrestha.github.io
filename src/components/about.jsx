                      Hi, I am Shruti Shrestha. I am currently doing my master's in Data Science and Analytics at Georgia State University(GSU). I am currently working as a graduate research assistant in the Data Mining lab of the Department of Computer Science at GSU. I am fond of data science and machine learning. Prior to this degree, I have 3 plus years of working experience as a machine learning engineer, deep learning engineer, and a software developer. 
                       </p>
<p>
I am currently looking for opportunities for summer internship, 2022 where I could use my working experiences, and academic knowledge to solve real life business problems.
